# Moarloser / Enufhud
This hud is a fork of the legendary **m0rehud** created by [m0re](https://web.archive.org/web/20090805060945/http://www.m0re.nocrits.com/) somewhere in **2008-2009**.<br><br>
It is based on an old version of [Hypnootize's](https://github.com/Hypnootize/m0rehud) maintained fork. Specifically **m0rehud 6.x/classic**

* The **source scheme** is a stripped down customised version of **old [moeshud](https://github.com/Hypnootize/TF2-HUDs-Archive/blob/master/Updated%20HUDs%20List.md)**, which in turn was based on **old [rayshud](https://github.com/raysfire/rayshud)**.
  * **Additionally**, the source scheme is fitted with **patched aliased Microsoft fonts** for Linux's FreeType renderer on Source 1.
* The main menu is a slightly modified version of the forked [**Broeselhud**](https://github.com/TF2HUDsArchive/Broesel-Hud) by Hypnootize.
* The hud is built to largely inherit from the default hud. Some improvements are carried over from [idhud](https://github.com/idhud-tf2/idhud).

# Goal
My goal with this hud was just creating a barebones hud which stays true to the original TF2 hud and aesthetic, while implementing my own taste of visual clarity.<br>
It doesn't have a strict design language. The goal is just utilitarian if anything.<br>

# Patched fonts on Linux
I do not like the anti-aliased font replacements Valve ships as substitute for the Microsoft fonts used in the Source 1 source scheme. <br>
Source 1's Linux font renderer uses FreeType, which works differently to the font renderer used on Windows builds of Source 1. One quirk is that it outright ignores the `antialias` attribute on fonts.<br>

That's why this hud ships with patched MS fonts, used in the original Source 1 windows source scheme. They should render 1:1 as they do on Windows.<br>
